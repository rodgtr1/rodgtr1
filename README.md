ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Travis

I was 34 years old in a job I hated when I decided to learn to code.

I had only planned to stay in that job for 6 months while I looked for something better. And that 6 months unfortunately turned into 10 years.

Time flies!

However, during the latter part of that 10 years I started a blog (non-dev related). That blog led me to having to learn a little HTML and CSS which I found thrilling; so much so that I ended up enrolling in a coding bootcamp.

Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and building websites was a whole new world for me. And a really, really exciting one!

During the first half of this bootcamp, I started taking on whatever freelance work I could find. I just couldnâ€™t get enough!

And when my job announced that it would be outsourcing our department I decided to go for it: to jump into the world of freelance web development full time.

I soon quit the bootcamp (see ya Ruby on Rails) and became a freelancer.

And the rest is history â€¦ a history thatâ€™s documented on my [blog](https://travis.media).

I went from working in WordPress/PHP for agencies to a 100% success score on Upwork. 

I later made my way back into the corporate office as a software developer working on large sites like Golf.com and eventually large-scale mission-critical systems as a DevOps engineer/SRE.

Thatâ€™s the short story. If you want more juicy details, watch [this video](https://youtu.be/UAgUmy7OMQs)

Currently, I'm a Developer Relations Engineer creating content for developers (like you), and interacting with dev communities. 

The best place to find me is on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@TravisMedia) where I'm consistently sharing all that I'm learning along the way. See you there!
